        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I make these Christmas cookies every year! They're soft cut-out sugar cookies that I sprinkle with colored sugar before baking. You can frost them with icing when cool if you prefer.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
           <li>3 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
           <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
           <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
           <li>1 cup margarine, softened</li>
           <li>2 large eggs</li>
           <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl; set aside.</li>
            <li>Beat sugar and margarine in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Wrap dough; chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Beat first egg into butter mixture. Beat second egg into mixture along with vanilla extract; add flour mixture and stir until dough is just combined.</li>
            <li>Wrap dough; chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease two cookie sheets.</li>
            <li>Roll out dough on a clean floured surface to 1/4-inch thickness. Cut out shapes using cookie cutters; arrange them on the prepared cookie sheets. Gather scraps and repeat this step.</li>
            <li>Bake in batches in the preheated oven until edges are golden, about 6 to 8 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet briefly before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>

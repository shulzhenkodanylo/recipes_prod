            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a medium stock pot over medium heat. Saute onion and celery until tender.</li>
            <li>Add broccoli and broth, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree.
